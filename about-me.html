        <h3>Just a girl who reads...</h3>
        <img src="Images/pic12.jpg" alt="Me">
<p>I'm a simple, 20-year-old girl who enjoys reading. I decided to create this website in order to convince more people to get into reading books. It's a hobby that I want to share with the world. My goal is to remind people how fun reading could be, and make it more widespread in a generation where entertainment is dominated by the movie industry.</p>
