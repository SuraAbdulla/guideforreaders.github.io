      <p>
        Each person has their own taste, so naturally, there would be books that you'd like, and others that you'd dislike. If you find yourself feeling bored when reading a particular genre, then that might mean that it's simply not for you. And that's not a bad thing! Finding what interests you as a reader is a fun journey of its own, so the next time you feel like it, hit up your local library and try out a different variety of books. That should help you get an idea of your preferred genre, which will help you enjoy reading like never before.

      <h3>Find a favorite author:</h3>

      <p>
        Every author has their own unique writing style which attracts different types of people. If you liked a book that's published by a particular author, chances are that you'd like the other books published by them, too. There is something invisible in different writing styles that you can't describe as anything but magic, so if you're already enchanted by a specific style of writing of an author, you should search for different authors that share a similar writing style. You're bound to find something there.

      <h3>Make bookworm friends:</h3>

      <p>
        Having friends to share books and rant about characters with is one of the best experiences for a reader. Sharing your opinions and book recommendations with your friends will make you feel more motivated to read books. You'll find yourself wanting to catch up on the hype of the books your friends talk about, and soon, you'll be making your own list of book recommendations to share with them the next time you meet.
      </p>
      <h3>Don't force yourself to read:</h3>

      <p>
        Every reader goes through a reading slump, where you simply don't feel like reading <i>any</i> books at all. And that's natural. Sometimes, you simply need to take a break and spend your time exercising your other hobbies. The itch to read will come back sooner or later, so don't exhaust yourself by reading books when you aren't enjoying it. When you're ready to pick a book up again, make sure to find a quiet place where no one would disturb you, and snuggle up with the book as you allow your imagination to run wild.
